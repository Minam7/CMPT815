<p>
In this project we mainly focus on following four insights.

• *Long-term popularity evolution of a course based on registration*

• *The relation between Student Assessment and use of online resources*

• *Temporal patterns of time spent in MOOCs*

• *Exploratory analysis of forums of Coursera and Standford dataset*
</p>

<h4> Long-term popularity evolution of a course based on registration </h4>

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
library(dplyr)
library(highcharter)

oulad_course_popularity <- oulad_studentRegistration %>% group_by(code_module, code_presentation) %>% summarise(count = n())
oulad_course_popularity <- with(oulad_course_popularity, oulad_course_popularity[order(code_presentation, code_module, count),])

mean_student_registration = mean(oulad_course_popularity[['count']])

oulad_course_popularity  %>% 
  hchart(type = "line", hcaes(x = code_presentation, y = count, group = code_module)) %>% 
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Popularity"), tickInterval = 100,
           plotLines = list(list(color = "#FF0000", width = 2, value = mean_student_registration, dashStyle = 'shortdash'))
           ) %>% 
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Term"), categories= list('2013B','2013J','2014B','2014J')) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Course Popularity based on Student Registration", style = list(fontWeight = "bold"))
```

<p>
As we can see in this chart, more popular courses have more students in October terms, which is denoted by letter J at the end of term. However, less popular courses doesn't follow such pattern.
